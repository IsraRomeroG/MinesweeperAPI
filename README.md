### Mines Generation Algorithm:
The mines generation algorithm is really simple, basically works with the following steps:

1- Get the number of cells multiplying the width by the height of the board.

2- Generates a random number into a range proportional to the number of cells.

3- Take the random number generated and mark the corresponding cell in the board as a mine.

4- Add 1 to the value to all cells around the new mine.

5- Repeat until finishing placing all mines.

### Reveal Cells Algorithm
The reveal cells algorithm is a little bit more complex, in this case I've done a recursive algorithm:

1- Open the requested cell.

2- If the opened cell is a number or a mine then finish the algorithm.

3- If the opened cell is an empty cell then continue with the next step (4).

4- Open all adjacent cells.

5- Validate if some adjacent cell is a **way\*** to continue exploring.

6- If some adjacent cell is a **way\*** the algorithm return to the step 1 in a recursive form from this new position.

\**A way is a cell that is empty and has at least 1 hidden cell around it*

### Model:
- I decided to use the java.util.UUID to generate unique ids for each game.
- A user can have many games.
- A game has a board.
- A board has an array of cells.
- A cell has an id, a value and a boolean that indicates if the cell is hidden or not.


### UPLOADING:
To upload the proyect I used an EC2 instance from AWS.

In the beggining I tried to consume the API directly from the EC2 instance URL but I get an error from the browser due to the HTTPS protocol was required.

I needed to enable HTTPS and configure a valid certificate, in order to do this I used a Load Balancer and a certified given by AWS Certificate Manager.
